# Technical Tour

{% hint style="success" %}
Technical tour will be held _**outside, rain or shine,**_ please make sure to wear appropriate attire. Average New England temperatures during October can reach as low as 30° F / -1° C.

## Technical Tour

The technical tour will include two separate events about 1.5 miles apart. The group will be split in two with the first group attending Team O’Neil (TON) Rally School Tarmac events and the second group attending the autonomy demonstrations at nearby Ridge Runner Promotions. The teams will meet back at TON for lunch before switching areas for the afternoon session. The day will start with pickup at the hotel at 0700 for an 0800 start of the demonstrations and will return to the hotel around 1730 that evening. This combination of events will: 1) Demonstrate possibilities and the limits of highspeed vehicle control on asphalt with instruction/discussions on how this applies to high-speed driving on gravel, snow-covered, and sometimes rough terrain condition, and 2) showcase the current state of “high-speed” autonomous navigation in complex off-road conditions. The pairing of these events will allow both fields to see where improvements and techniques can be shared between the manned and unmanned worlds of extreme driving.

### Team O’Neil Demonstrations

* Vehicle Dynamics and Soft Soil Mobility by multi-time Rally Champions Tim O’Neil and North American Rally champion Travis Hansen.
* Static display and introduction to Rally cars and their modifications for high-speed, paved and unpaved-road performance.
* Ride-along asphalt rally experience (1 to 3 per vehicle, depending on number of participants and schedule.)

### Autonomy Demonstrations

Off-road vehicle autonomy presents unique challenges beyond those facing on-road autonomy due to the unpredictable and varied nature of off-road environments. The exploration and extension of novel modeling, estimation, and control methodologies and frameworks spanning from the subsystems to system, and system-of-system are crucial for unlocking the full potential of autonomous off-road vehicles. In particular, developing robust and reliable technologies for off-road autonomy will incorporate applications across diverse sectors, including agriculture, mining, construction, military and defense. This operational demonstration and workshop aims to bring together the autonomous vehicle community to jointly explore the technical challenges, showcase promising technical directions, and outline opportunities for future exploration. Specifically, the objectives of the workshop/demo will focus on theoretical and machine learning comparisons and promote a technical exchange between government, industry, and academic participants. the event will include four (4) or five (5) teams, all showcasing different off-road autonomous vehicle navigation approaches. The expectation is that the associated workshop will summarize the demonstration for inclusion in the discussion and publication on the research needs.

The autonomy teams will be demonstrating their hardware and navigation software on unpaved and vegetated trails at Ridge Runner Promotions ATV site. This site consists of open grassy and gravel road areas, wooded trails, an unmaintained motorcross track, steep hill climb track and potentially some small water features. The image below shows the outline of the property and the attacked KMZ file will allow you to view this in google earth. Demo teams will have access to this site a few days prior to the event to gather information as required for their autonomy demonstrations.

## Autonomy Workshop

The Autonomy workshop will be held on Friday to discuss the demonstrations and define the key needs and questions related to autonomy.  The results of the workshop will be presented in a publication in the Journal of Terramechanics. The Autonomy workshop on Friday is co-organized by GVSC and will be held at the CRREL auditorium so _**will require registration but is**_ _**free of charge.**_
