Dr. van Susante is an endowed assistant professor at Michigan Technological University in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department and the founder and PI of the Planetary Surface Technology Development Lab (PSTDL), also known as HuskyWorks. Dr. van Susanteâ€™s research focuses on robotic systems for In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) and construction and in particular, robotic mechanical systems under lunar and mars conditions interacting with the lunar and Mars surface. He is actively researching, developing and testing technologies under lunar and mars environmental conditions for detecting volatiles in lunar regolith, determining geotechnical properties of lunar regolith, excavating, conveying and compacting (icy, cemented) lunar regolith, excavating (cemented) lunar regolith, excavating gypsum and extracting water from excavated gypsum and buried glaciers for Mars applications as well as developing power transfer via (superconducting) tether into the lunar Permanently Shade Regions. Dr. van Susante is PI on multiple NASA and industry funded ISRU projects with a combined value of over $5.6M.
