### About Algoryx

Founded in 2007 as a spin-off from UmeÃ¥ University, Algoryx is a global leader in real-time physics simulation for complex machinery, vehicles, and robotics. Our physics-informed digital twins are essential for innovation in off-highway autonomy, vehicle-terrain interaction, and AI-driven control systems. These simulations support the entire development cycleâ€”from conceptual design and systems engineering to validation, verification, and machine learning-based autonomy.

Algoryxâ€™s technology is widely used in construction, mining, forestry, agriculture, and defense, where vehicles must navigate extreme terrains with high precision. By enabling realistic, high-fidelity simulation of soft soil, granular materials, and complex vehicle dynamics, we help industry leaders reduce development time, optimize designs, and train AI-driven control systems in virtual environments before real-world deployment.

Our solutions also extend beyond Earth: the space industry leverages Algoryxâ€™s technology for developing and testing robotic systems and autonomous vehicles for planetary exploration, where Earth-based trials are impractical or impossible.
