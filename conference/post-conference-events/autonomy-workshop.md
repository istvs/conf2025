### About

The workshop aims to integrate the knowledge from the conference demonstrations, technical talks and assembled off-road mobility experts.

The schedule will follow this general order:

1. Panel discussion on Autonomy Methods for Off-Road Navigation motivated using specific questions of interest to the off-road community.
2. Short description and impressions from the live demonstration teams.
3. Open but guided discussion loosely adhering to an after-action review (AAR) or lesson’s learned format to recap:
   1. What was planned
   2. What was accomplished
   3. The different approaches and what worked well or not-so-well
   4. The overall level of effort of implementing specific technical solutions (overall effort meaning – the development/testing/training time to implement their specific algorithmic solution on a new platform, the fiscal and/or time cost related to hardware requirements or software development and testing time, the types of technical backgrounds of the engineers and students required to implement their solution confidently, etc.)
   5. What could be improved for the future

The results of the workshop will be documented in a publication in the Journal of Terramechanics reporting on off-road autonomy techniques, suitability, issues, level of effort for operating in off-road environments, and concepts for future developments. The workshop is _**free of charge but registration is required**_. Sponsorships are welcome to help cover conference and demonstrations/tour costs.
